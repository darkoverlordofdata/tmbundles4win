TextMate has an open-source repository for bundles. However, many of the files have characters that are illegal under Windows.  It it the aim of this project to mirror the TextMate repository, but with characters that are legal under the Windows NTFS filesystem.

This project is [mirrored to GitHub](http://github.com/gtcaz/tmbundles4win/tree/master) for your cloning and branching pleasure.

This is a sub-project of the [eBundles project](http://code.google.com/p/ebundles/).
