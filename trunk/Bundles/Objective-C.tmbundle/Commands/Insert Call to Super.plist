	<string># Inserts a [super method] call suitable for the current method.
# Inserted as a snippet with the incoming arguments used as defaults.
#
# The default behavior is to add brackets if there is no "[" to the left
# of the caret (ignoring the tab trigger). This can be changed by changing
# from "automatic" to one of "always" and "never". The last argument
# is appended at the end of the result (some prefer the empty string, others
# a semicolon.
#
# The command uses heuristics to find which method implementation is
# being edited. It should be reasonably tolerant to various coding styles,
# including different bracket and indentation styles.
